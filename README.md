# 👩‍💻 Dorcas Wanja Njeri  

Hi there! 👋 I'm **Dorcas Njeri**, a coding newbie on a journey
to conquer the tech world
(one line of code at a time).
I’m currently part of the Foundation's track at MIT Emerging Talent Program,
diving deep into **Python**, **Git**, and all things **data science**.  

## 🌱 My learning adventures

- 🐍 Tackling **Python Programming** with lots of  curiosity and caffeine. 😊
- 🛠️ Mastering **Git and GitHub**, AKA the art of version control.  
- 📊 Discovering the secrets of **data science** (step aside, Sherlock!).  

### 🎯 My Current Goals

- Crack the coding basics like a pro. 💪  
- Build small projects that scream, “I’m learning, but I’m awesome!”  
- Collaborate with cool people (yes, that means YOU!).😉

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I’m not just a coder-in-training—I’m also a bookworm 📚
I love diving into fictional worlds.
When I’m not learning, you’ll find me binge-reading novels or exploring new hobbies.
Let’s grow together!🌟

<!--I am keeping the "!" to show my anticipation-->

## I look forward to working with you!
